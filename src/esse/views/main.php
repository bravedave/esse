<h1><?= \config::$WEBNAME ?></h1>

<p>PHP exploits the PSR-4 Autoload standard</p>

<p>There are many subsequent standards, but PSR-2 & PSR-4 concern themselves
  with the autoload capabilities of composer distributed apps</p>

<p>By crafting file locations and namespaces many php scrips can be combined
  into a powerful application without the need to specifically include files</p>

<p>This could be termed an MVC app, data is left out - so this is just view
  and controller</p>

<p>It does reach out to Bootstrap for some styling, but it's minimal</p>
